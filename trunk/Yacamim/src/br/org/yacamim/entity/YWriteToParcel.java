/**
 * This annotation class is meant to be use when it's necessary to sign to <strong>Yacamim</strong> that an field (that is accessed from a getter) of a <tt>BaseEntity</tt> subclass will not 
 * be persisted when the class it's member of will be "parceled" (serialized). Its default value is <tt>true</tt>, so when it's desired to a field 
 * not to be "parceled" as part of all instance, it's necessary to set it ro <tt>false</tt>.<br/>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Ex.:</strong><br/><br/>
 * public class User extends BaseEntity {<br/><br/>
 * 
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@YWriteToParcel(false)<br/>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private String getPassword() {<br/>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return this.password;<br/>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/><br/>
 * 
 * }<br/>
